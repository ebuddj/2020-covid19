## Number of confirmed Covid-19 cases per continent

Chinese authorities informed the WHO on January 9 that a new virus was the cause of multiple pneumonia cases in the country, sounding the alarm to what became the COVID-19 pandemic.

The graphs show the number of confirmed Covid-19 cases per continent:
1) [First graph shows the cumulative number of cases](https://ebuddj.github.io/2020-covid19/#data=cumulative)
2) [Second graph shows the average number of new daily cases in a 14 day period](https://ebuddj.github.io/2020-covid19/#data=daily)

The graph shows the data on a linear scale and the numbers are absolute.

The colors for continents have been taken from from [this map](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Continents_by_colour.png).

Data is between 31st January 2020 and 6th July 2020.
