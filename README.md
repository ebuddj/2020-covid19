## Number of confirmed Covid-19 cases per continent (EBU)

Chinese authorities informed the WHO on January 9 that a new virus was the cause of multiple pneumonia cases in the country, sounding the alarm to what became the COVID-19 pandemic.

There are four different animations with different data sets:
1) [First graph shows the cumulative number of cases per continent](https://ebuddj.github.io/2020-covid19/#data=cumulative)
2) [Second graph shows the average number of new daily cases in a 14 day period per continent](https://ebuddj.github.io/2020-covid19/#data=daily)
3) [Third graph the cumulative number of deaths in selected four Nordic countries](https://ebuddj.github.io/2020-covid19/#data=cumulative_scandinavia)
4) [Fourth graph shows the number of new daily cases in a 14 day period in selected four Nordic countries per 100,000 population](https://ebuddj.github.io/2020-covid19/#data=daily_scandinavia)

The graph shows the data on a linear scale. The numbers are absolute expect on the fourth one where the numbers are relative to each country's population.

The colors for the continents have been taken from from [this map](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Continents_by_colour.png). The continents appear in the following order: Asia, Europe, North America, South America, Africa, Oceania which resembles how the outbreak spread chronologically. 

Data is between 31st January 2020 and 13th July 2020.
